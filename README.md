# Plant Pathology

<h3>Computer Vision Project</h3>

<h5>Problem Statement</h5>

This is dataset of "Plant Pathology 2020 - FGVC7" competition In this we are challenged to diagnose plant diseases solely based on leaf images. The categories include "healthy", "scab", "rust", and "multiple diseases".

In this kernel, I will visualize the data with Matplotlib and Plotly and then demonstrate some important image processing and augmentation techniques using OpenCV. Finally, I will show how different pretrained Keras models, such as DenseNet and EfficientNet, can be used to solve the problem.

1) To run this file first download the dataset and Notebook file.
2) Now go to kaggle Notebook editor and import the dataset and the notebook file.
3) In the settings turn on the internet on kaggle notebook and select accelerator as TPU.
4) Run all and now you can see the results.

 Note : While running it can give error respective of the libraries to import according to versions. So , you may need to install those libraries from yourself while running depending on the Kaggle Notebook environment.
